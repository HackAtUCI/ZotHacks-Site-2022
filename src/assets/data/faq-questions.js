    question: "What is ZotHacks?",
    answer: "ZotHacks is a place where the only thing limiting what you build is your own creativity – we'll provide the rest. We give you the resources, training, mentorship, and food you need in order for you to build a full web application with a team.",
	},
	// {
  //   question: "What should I bring?",
  //   answer: "Yourself, an idea, a photo ID, your laptop, and chargers. We also have a list of the required software to download on laptops prior to the hackathon that we will send out later as the hackathon draws near.",

	// {
  //   question: "How will team formations work for admitted students?",

	// },
	{
    question: "What if I have no prior experience in programming, coding, or hackathons?",

	},
	{
    question: "Who should attend?",
    answer: "If you do not know much or anything about web development but are interested in learning how to build web apps, you are the ideal candidate for ZotHacks. This year, we would like only first and second years of UCI to be attendees; for those who are transfers or third years and up, consider applying to be a mentor!",
	},
	{
    question: "Do I sign up as a team or individual?",
    answer: "You will apply as an individual. We will be personally reviewing each application and accepting on an individual basis.",

	// {
  //   question: "Are there swag and food? sponsors, swag, and food?",
  //   answer: "Of course! Get hyped!",
	// },
	{
    question: "Am I allowed to come with a project pre-built or will I be building the project from scratch?",
    answer: "You will be building projects from scratch, although we will be offering starter packs to help you get started. You are encouraged to come with ideas of what you want to build.",
  },
  {
    question: "What platform will you be using to host ZotHacks?",
    answer: "Currently we are testing out several different platforms for ZotHacks 2020. As of right now ZotHacks will be using Slack as our way of main source of communication for the event. Expect announcements, mentor support and memes to be discussed here! However, as far as other platforms being considered, Hoppin, Discord and Zoom are big contenders to make events, workshops and team collaborations easier with separate channels or rooms to join!"
